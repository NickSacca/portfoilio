              <p>My name is Nicolas Sacca and I am a Freshmen at Dublin Highschool. I have been around my computers thourought my whole life and I have always had an interest in them. My dad who works at juniper networks showed me all about computers, what you can do with them, how they work, and how to build them. I have used this interest to join the computer science class that they provide at Dublin Highschool to learn more about computers, and learn coding languages. Even though I'm only a beginner I will take my time to learn the ways of web development and other programs.</p>
              <p>As of now I am not taking apart in any clubs or sports in Dublin Highschool, but I have partaken in the freshman football program that they offered at Dublin High and gained a lot of knowledge in the game of football. It is definitely another interest I have but I don't like it as much as computers/computer science. I have and always will have a passion with computers and how they work. They are very interesting pieces of equipment and I hope one day that I can have a job or a lot of experience in them if I ever choose a different career pathway.</p>
